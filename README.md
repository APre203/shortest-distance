# shortest-distance
Shortest distance game using pygame

How to play:
1. Run the program
2. You will see a counter on the top, this is the time to click on the screen to create barriers (The counter can be changed by chaning the global variable "count")
3. After you finished placing the barriers the program will run by itself and will illustrate how it runs by painting the path it takes red

If it finds the end path without hitting any barrier it will return the path in blue. If not, it will print Path Not Found.
